        <p>Sokka is a Southern Water Tribe warrior and the sun of Chief Hakoda and Kya. He was born wihtout any bending ability, so he became a fighter for the tribe instead. Sokka is the older brother of Katara. Katara and him were raised by their grandmother after their mother died and their father went to go fight in the war. Sokka was left behind when the other men went to fight in the war. As the oldest male in the Southern Water Tribe he was left as their leader, and became responsible for everyone in the tribe. </p>
        <p>Sokka and his sister, Katara, found Avatar Aang frozen in an iceburg. After finding out Aang was the avatar that had disappeared, he was skeptical, but decided to help Aang on his quest to save the world.</p>
